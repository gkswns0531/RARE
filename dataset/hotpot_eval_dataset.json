In contrast with the 1961 film, none of the animals talk in this version.  Released on November 27, 1996 by Walt Disney Pictures, the film was praised for its faithfulness to the animated classic.  It received mixed reviews, but was a commercial success, grossing $320.6 million in theaters against a $75 million budget.  Close, who was universally praised for her portrayal as Cruella de Vil, was nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Performance by an Actress in a Motion Picture - Comedy or Musical, but lost to Madonna in \"Evita\".  The film was also nominated for a BAFTA award for best makeup effects.

The storm lashed the east coast of the United States with high waves and coastal flooding before turning to the southwest and weakening.  Moving over warmer waters, the system transitioned into a subtropical cyclone before becoming a tropical storm.  It executed a loop off the Mid-Atlantic states and turned toward the northeast.  On November 1 the system evolved into a full-fledged hurricane with peak winds of 75 miles per hour (120 km/h), although the National Hurricane Center left it unnamed to avoid confusion amid media interest in the predecessor extratropical storm.  It later received the name \"the Perfect Storm\" (playing off the common expression) after a conversation between Boston National Weather Service forecaster Robert Case and author Sebastian Junger.  The system was the fourth hurricane and final tropical cyclone in the 1991 Atlantic hurricane season.  The tropical system weakened, striking Nova Scotia as a tropical storm before dissipating.",

Three major weather systems originating from the Atlantic accounted for large snowfalls totaling around four meters in the area.

The storm maintained this intensity as it made landfall on Odisha on 29 October.

The main theme is an electronic transcription of Henry Purcell's \"Music for the Funeral of Queen Mary\", composed in 1695, for the procession of Queen Mary's cortège through London en route to Westminster Abbey.  \"March from 'A Clockwork Orange'\" (based on the choral movement of the Ninth Symphony by Beethoven) was the first recorded song featuring a vocoder for the singing; synthpop bands often cite it as their inspiration.  Neither the end credits nor the soundtrack album identify the orchestra playing the Ninth Symphony excerpts, however, in Alex's bedroom, there is a close-up of a microcassette tape labeled: \"Deutsche Grammophon – Ludwig van Beethoven – Symphonie Nr.  9 d-moll, op. 125 – Berliner Philharmoniker – Chor der St. Hedwigskathedrale – Ferenc Fricsay – Irmgard Seefried, Maureen Forrester, Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau, Ernst Haefliger\".",

It does so mainly by acting on the mineralocorticoid receptors in the distal tubules and collecting ducts of the nephron.  It influences the reabsorption of sodium and excretion of potassium (from and into the tubular fluids, respectively) of the kidney, thereby indirectly influencing water retention or loss, blood pressure and blood volume.  When dysregulated, aldosterone is pathogenic and contributes to the development and progression of cardiovascular and renal disease.

This was challenged by Virginia agrarians Thomas Jefferson and James Madison, who formed a rival party, the Democratic-Republican Party.

Named after the song \"All Tomorrow's Parties\" by The Velvet Underground, the festival exhibited a tendency towards post-rock, avant-garde, and underground hip hop, along with more traditional rock fare presented in an environment more intimate than a giant stadium or huge country field.  It was at first a sponsorship-free festival where the organisers and artists stay in the same accommodation as the fans.  It claimed to set itself apart from festivals like Reading or Glastonbury by staying intimate, non-corporate and fan-friendly.  Another vital difference is that the line-ups are chosen by significant bands or artists, resulting in unorthodox events which often combine acts of all sizes, eras, and genres.",

Plants of the genus \"Amaryllis\" are known as belladonna lily, Jersey lily, naked lady, amarillo, Easter lily in Southern Australia or, in South Africa, March lily due to its propensity to flower around March.

During the trip, he is accompanied by his Chinese valet, Passepartout (Jackie Chan).  For comedic reasons, the film intentionally deviated wildly from the novel and included a number of anachronistic elements.  With production costs of about $110 million and estimated marketing costs of $30 million, it earned $24 million at the U.S. box office and $72 million worldwide, making it a box office flop.  It was Arnold Schwarzenegger's last film before he took a hiatus from acting to become Governor of California until 2010's \"The Expendables\".",

He was also a leading Indian-Assamese litterateur of the famed 'Awahon-Ramdhenu Era' of Assamese literature during the mid-20th century.  He was the author of a total of 115 English and Assamese books including textbooks on a range of fifteen subjects including economics, ancient Assamese literature, philosophy, education, religion, mythology, archaeology, tribal study, poetry, drama, memoirs, civics, political science, biographies; he also edited books and journals.  He also authored a variety of research papers and articles about the state of Assam, a state in the north-eastern part of India.  He pioneered the writing of books on Economics in Assamese.  His Assamese book \"Axomor Arthaneeti\" was the first ever research-based comprehensive book on Assam Economics, which was published for the first time in 1963.  Until this book on Assam Economics was published, there was hardly any comprehensive research-based material available on this crucial topic.  Because of his monumental social and intellectual contributions to Assam, he had been conferred with the honorary title of 'Asom Ratna' -- 'Jewel of Assam' by the intellectuals of Assam on 19 August 2007 at a public meet held under the presidency of Prof. (Dr) Satyendra Narayan Goswami.",

The massacre was wrongly blamed on the communists.  For four decades the South Korean government concealed this massacre.  Survivors were forbidden by the government from revealing it, under suspicion of being communist sympathizers.  Public revelation carried with it the threat of torture and death.  During the 1990s and onwards, several corpses were excavated from mass graves, resulting in public awareness of the massacre.",

The stories follow a consistent pattern: the people are unfaithful to Yahweh and he therefore delivers them into the hands of their enemies; the people repent and entreat Yahweh for mercy, which he sends in the form of a leader or champion (a \"judge\"); the judge delivers the Israelites from oppression and they prosper, but soon they fall again into unfaithfulness and the cycle is repeated.

The height of the conflict came in 1916 when revolutionary Pancho Villa attacked the American border town of Columbus, New Mexico.  In response, the United States Army, under the direction of General John J. Pershing, launched an expedition into northern Mexico, to find and capture Villa.  Though the operation was successful in finding and engaging the Villista rebels, and in killing Villa's two top lieutenants, the revolutionary himself escaped and the American army returned to the United States in January 1917.  Conflict at the border continued however and the United States launched several more smaller operations into Mexican territory until after the American victory in the Battle of Ambos Nogales, leading to the establishment of a permanent border wall.  Conflict was not only subject to Villistas and Americans; \"Maderistas\", \"Carrancistas\", \"Constitutionalistas\" and Germans also engaged in battle with American forces during this period.",

Leaves to 6 in (15 cm) long, narrow and bluntly toothed, appear at intervals along the branches, mostly in whorls of 6.  In summer, the plant bears white flowers densely crowded on spikes arising from rusty buds at the leaf axils.  The fruits to 2 in (5 cm) long, magenta to reddish brown, similar to an almond, appear in autumn.  The nut is too bitter to eat; however, in earlier times it was boiled, roasted, and ground to make a \"coffee\" drink.",

Described by Cyrus as a \"good [record] to blast in your car\", \"Can't Be Tamed\" represents a musical departure from her earlier work, which she had grown to feel uninspired by.  As executive producers, Tish Cyrus and Jason Morey enlisted partners including Devrim Karaoglu, Marek Pompetzki, Rock Mafia, and John Shanks to achieve Cyrus' desired new sound.  Their efforts resulted in a primarily dance-pop record, which Cyrus' record label acknowledged differed from the original plans for the project.

The city has served as the capital of Nevada since statehood in 1864 and for much of its history was a hub for the Virginia and Truckee Railroad, although the tracks were removed in the 1950s.  Prior to 1969, Carson City was the county seat of Ormsby County.  In 1969, the county was abolished, and its territory merged with Carson City to form the Consolidated Municipality of Carson City.

He was born in Copenhagen and began studies of botany at the University of Copenhagen in 1910, at first with professor Eugenius Warming, then with professor Christen Raunkiær.  His doctoral dissertation (1921) was on the influence of soil pH on the natural distribution of plants.  He was then employed by the Carlsberg Laboratory as an assistant to the chemist S. P. L. Sørensen, later in his own lab.  There, he worked on plant uptake of ions, especially iron, nitrogen fixation and calcicolous plants.",

For example, Voltaire sought the presentation of static tableaus that expressed emotion, as in the first act of the 1737 version which begins at the scene of Castor's tomb with a Chorus of Spartans singing \"Que tout gemisse\", followed by a recitative between Telaire and Phoebe in which the former is grieving the loss of her lover Castor, and culminating in Telaire's lament aria \"Tristes apprets\".  Dill notes that in contrast, the 1754 version begins with much more background behind the story of Telaire's love for Castor and depicts his death at the end.  The events in Act I of the 1737 version appear in Act II of the 1754 version.  Dill claims that Voltaire was more interested in music than action in opera.  Moreover, Dill notes a difference in the plots between in the two versions.  In the 1737 version, the main concern is for the moral dilemma between love and duty that Pollux faces: should he pursue his love of Telaira or rescue his brother?  Of course, he chooses the latter.  In the 1754 version, Dill remarks that that plot is more concerned with the tests that Pollux must face: he must kill Lynceus, persuade Jupiter not to oppose his journey into the Underworld, and persuade Castor not to accept the gift of immortality.",

This claim was based on his status as the eldest son of James Francis Edward Stuart, himself the son of James VII and II.  Charles is perhaps best known as the instigator of the unsuccessful Jacobite uprising of 1745, in which he led an insurrection to restore his family to the throne of Great Britain.  The uprising ended in defeat at the Battle of Culloden, effectively terminating the Jacobite cause.  Jacobites supported the Stuart claim because they hoped for religious toleration for Roman Catholics and because they believed in the divine right of kings.  Charles's flight from Scotland after the uprising has rendered him a romantic figure of heroic failure in some later representations.  In 1759 he was involved in a French plan to invade Britain, which was abandoned after British naval victories.",

Unusually broad in scope, \"Chrysalis\" did not substitute breadth for quality.  The authors, poets, essayists, and researchers contributing to the magazine reveals a veritable who's who of towering intellects of the feminist movement: black lesbian activist Audre Lorde; the magazine's poetry editor, Robin Morgan, who later served as editor of Ms. from 1990-1993: award winning poet Adrienne Rich; novelist Marge Percy; artist Judy Chicago; science fiction writer Joanna Russ; art critic Lucy Lippard, plus Mary Daly, Dolores Hayden, Andrea Dworkin, Marilyn Hacker, Arlene Raven, and Elizabeth Janeway.

In 1940, Attlee took Labour into the wartime coalition government and served under Winston Churchill, becoming the first person to hold the office of Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.  He went on to lead the Labour Party to an unexpected landslide victory at the 1945 general election; forming the first Labour majority government, and a mandate to implement its postwar reforms.  The 12.0% national swing from the Conservatives to Labour was unprecedented at that time and remains the largest ever achieved by any party at a general election in British electoral history.  He was re-elected with a narrow majority at the 1950 general election.  In the following year, Attlee called a snap general election, hoping to increase his parliamentary majority.  However, he was narrowly defeated by the Conservatives under the leadership of Winston Churchill; despite winning the most votes of any political party in any general election in British political history until the Conservative Party's fourth consecutive victory in 1992.  Attlee remains the longest-ever serving Leader of the Labour Party.",

Depending on the cat registry, they may be considered a separate breed of cat, or more often a variant of a pre-existing one, if accepted at all.  These cats are distinguished by their conformance to wide range of sixteen different point colors, beyond the four standard Siamese colors.  The variety was initially created by crossbreeding Siamese with the American Shorthair – the same mixture that created the Oriental Shorthair, but with different goals.  The Colorpoint Shorthair shares the point-coloration pattern with the Siamese, but in the nontraditional colors of red, cream, tortoiseshell, and lynx (tabby) points, and minor variations thereof.  In body style, head shape, and other features, it may be intermediate between the two foundation breeds, which show cats leaning toward Siamese traits.  Those who favour the Traditional Siamese look may also favour the more moderate-typed Colourpoint Shorthairs that take after their American Shorthair ancestors in shape.",

Comhairle na dTeachtaí, never more than a symbolic body, was thereby rendered defunct.  In 1930 Cumann na nGaedheal TDs alleged in the Dáil that de Valera had addressed Comhairle na dTeachtaí in December 1926, after the foundation of Fianna Fáil; this was to cast aspersions on de Valera's commitment to the Constitution of the Irish Free State.",

With a screenplay by Kevin Brodbin and Frank Cappello, the film is based on DC Comics' \"Hellblazer\" comic book, with plot elements taken from the \"Dangerous Habits\" story arc (issues #4146) and the \"Original Sins\" story arc.  The film portrays John Constantine as a cynic with the ability to perceive and communicate with half-angels and half-demons in their true form.  He seeks salvation from eternal damnation in Hell for a suicide attempt in his youth.  Constantine exorcises demons back to Hell to earn favor with Heaven but has become weary over time.  With terminal lung cancer, he helps a troubled police detective learn the truth about her sister's death while simultaneously unraveling a much larger and darker plot.",

Franchitti started his career in his native United Kingdom in the early 1990s, competing in Formula Vauxhall and Formula Three and was also the winner of the McLaren Autosport BRDC Award in 1992.  After Franchitti did not secure a single-seater drive in 1995, he was contracted by the AMG team to compete in touring cars in the DTM and its successor — the International Touring Car Championship.  Despite 2 seasons with relative success, the series folded at the end of the 1996 season, again leaving Franchitti without a drive.  Mercedes placed Franchitti in CART in 1997 with the Hogan Racing team.",

It achieved popularity during the mid-1970s to the early 1980s.  Its initial audiences in the U.S. were club-goers from the gay, African American, Italian American, Latino, and psychedelic communities in Philadelphia and New York City during the late 1960s and early 1970s.  Disco can be seen as a reaction against both the domination of rock music and the stigmatization of dance music by the counterculture during this period.

There are a variety of doctoral degrees, with the most common being the Doctor of Philosophy (PhD), which is awarded in many different fields, ranging from the humanities to the scientific disciplines.  There are also some doctorates in the US, such as the Juris Doctor (JD), Doctor of Medicine (MD), Doctor of Dental Medicine (DMD), Doctor of Dental Surgery (DDS), Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (DO), Doctor of Chiropractic (DC), and Doctor of Pharmacy (Pharm.D.)  which are generally regarded internationally as professional degrees rather than doctorates, as they are not research degrees and no defense of any dissertation or thesis is performed.

At the Little Bighorn, the fieldwork produced an interpretation of the battle that for the first time gave a clear understanding of the way the battle developed and pointed out some of the glaring inaccuracies of the historiography of the event.  The fieldwork also helped determine which of the 242 headstones to the 210 U.S. soldiers lost at the Little Bighorn were erroneous, and recovered skeletal elements allowed one of the soldiers to be positively identified.

His self-confessed motive for the killings was a twisted fascination with female voices, especially when they were singing, and his claim that he killed the women to \"get at their voices.\"",

The castle was built to a quadrangular design, already slightly old-fashioned, on the site of an existing manor house overlooking the River Frome.  A park was attached to the castle, requiring the destruction of a local village.  His son, Sir Walter Hungerford, a successful knight and courtier to Henry V, became rich during the Hundred Years War with France and extended the castle with an additional, outer court, enclosing the parish church in the process.  By Walter's death in 1449, the substantial castle was richly appointed and its chapel decorated with murals.",

After writing it, Swift asked Anderson for authorization to record the song (due to personal references in the song); Anderson affirmed and it was ultimately included on \"Fearless\".  \"Fifteen\" is a ballad, which has Swift reminiscing on events that occurred to her and her best friend at the age of 15 and cautioning teenagers to not fall in love easily.",

The conflict was caused by Prussian ambitions to extend German unification and French fears of the shift in the European balance of power that would result if the Prussians succeeded.  Some historians argue that the Prussian chancellor Otto von Bismarck deliberately provoked a French attack in order to draw the independent southern German states—Baden, Württemberg, Bavaria and Hesse-Darmstadt—into an alliance with the North German Confederation dominated by Prussia, while others contend that Bismarck did not plan anything and merely exploited the circumstances as they unfolded.",

The other major version brings Goldilocks to the tale (replacing the old woman), and an even later version retained Goldilocks, but has the three bachelor bears transformed into Papa, Mama, and Baby Bear.",
